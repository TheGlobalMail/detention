                      </p><hr class="big-divider"><div class="story-text"><p>Night is enveloping the hills of Cisarua, a resort town high outside Jakarta, and the area’s evening rituals are beginning. Rainwater thunders down     from nearby mountaintops along hundreds of canals and rivulets that go whooshing on into the polluted sink that is Indonesia’s capital.</p><p>Across the bowl-shaped valley, dozens of mosques begin booming the call to prayer, all merging together into an asynchronous whine. In hillside villas,     groups of men from Saudi Arabia — some in traditional white thawb robes, some in baggy track pants – load up on the evening’s stock of     alcohol, which is banned in their home country. On motorbikes and in cars, pimps begin ferrying in the men’s other vice — Arabic-speaking     Indonesian women.</p><p>(See the photos behind the story: Barat Ali Batoor’s series from Cisarua, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/in-between-persecution-and-asylum/586/">In Between Persecution And Asylum</a>.)</p><p>In other rented houses, hundreds of asylum seekers sit with little to do. Many have become near-nocturnal out of sheer boredom, and are just starting     their day. Over the past decade, the town has become the unofficial haven for asylum seekers heading to Australia. For some, it is a brief stopover before     they jump on a smuggler’s boat. For others, it is a limbo that can last for years.</p><p>Haider — not his real name — is sitting in a living room with half-a-dozen other men who, like him, are Hazaras from the Pakistani city of     Quetta. All appear drawn and exhausted. One of the men, Ghulam Reza, sits with his foot extended because of an untreated, bloody gash.</p>

<p>True numbers of transients are fuzzy, but certainly those numbers are increasing. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) says there are     more than 7,200 registered asylum seekers in Indonesia. Nearly 2,000 more people living in Indonesia have been found to be refugees by the UNHCR, and about     750 have had <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unhcr.or.id/en/unhcr-inindonesia">their cases</a> for resettlement forwarded to a third country. (By comparison, in June     last year<a target="_blank" href="http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/you-heard-were-stopping-the-boats-you-heard-wrong/335/"> these numbers were</a> 4,766 asylum seekers and 1,219 refugees.)</p><p>Indonesia does not take refugees <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/7bea2c5c-c4fa-11e1-b6fd-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2PRw3qa5Q">on a permanent basis</a>. Those living here while waiting for their claims to be heard or for resettlement are barred from     working or sending their kids to Indonesian schools. If you are registered with the UNHCR you are, technically, allowed to live in the community, but being     caught without your papers — or while trying to hop on a boat to Australia — is likely to get you a ticket to detention.</p><p>Sitting above the smog of Jakarta, Cisarua also has a few other advantages for its transient population: it’s cheap, the area is used to keeping open     secrets, and the people smugglers know it well. The town is part of a strip, known as Puncak, that has long been a popular weekend getaway of     Jakarta’s middle class. On weekends, the area’s single main road is choked with cars and buses that crawl up through the mountainside tea     plantations.</p><p>In the 1990s, the town started earning a reputation as a sex-holiday destination for men from the Middle East, mostly Saudis. Puncak is the punchline for a     practice known in Indonesia as “contract marriages” — a kind of loophole used by some visitors to give an Islamic veneer to prostitution.     The practice usually involves a man offering a bride price in the range of 20 million to 30 million rupiah (about AUD 2,000-3,000) for a woman, explains     Hendi, a driver and pimp. A local cleric will officiate and once the holiday is done – which may be in three days or three months — the man     goes home, no questions asked. Under this system, women tend to marry multiple times. It is a deeply exploitative trade, which is accompanied by even more     prevalent regular prostitution.</p><p>National disgust and stricter law enforcement has reduced the trade, locals say, as has a realisation among many tourists that the brides on offer were     often experienced sex workers. Yet the business lives on.</p><p>“The Arabs have worked out the girls aren’t virgins, so we get younger girls,” Hendi explains. “I can get 14-, 15-year-olds. With     them you can’t tell the difference, even though they’re not virgins either.”</p><div  class="large-image-box left"><a href="http://cdn.theglobalmail.org/cache/04/02/0402c9ce212ff207b2a8750a1c56ab35.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="A Saudi tourist dances with an Indonesian sex worker."><img class="large-image" src="http://cdn.theglobalmail.org/cache/72/0d/720d010e1fa33c31e6f7b9143018ce42.jpg" alt="&lt;p&gt;Barat Ali Batoor&lt;/p&gt;" width="620" height="414"/><div class="slide-hover"></div></a><div class="story-bottom-box large-box"><div class="attribution"><p>Barat Ali Batoor</p></div><div class="caption">A Saudi tourist dances with an Indonesian sex worker.</div></div></div><p>Around the turn of the 20th century, Cisarua — with its expat Arab population, and locals who speak passable Arabic — became a natural     destination for Iraqis fleeing Saddam Hussein. Persian-speaking Afghan Hazaras and other nationalities soon followed.</p><p>These days, asylum seekers and the Saudi tourists live separately but in parallel, kept apart by differences in wealth, culture and the knowledge that for     some returning home is not an option. Asylum seekers often view the Saudis, and the Sunni theocracy from which they come, with disdain.</p><p>After arriving in Indonesia — often on smuggler-sponsored routes across Asia, on which a guide costs between $6,000 and $12,000 per person — asylum seekers usually follow a well-defined path to the area around Jalan Jaksa, a seedy strip of bars and hotels in central Jakarta. Nearby is the UNHCR     office, where people put their names down for asylum-seeker status. Securing an interview usually takes many months, which is in turn followed by a long     wait for any sort of decision on their case. Being resettled in another country can take years, and relatively few achieve it. In the meantime, adults are     forbidden to work, and children have very little chance of receiving a proper education.</p><p>Scouts for the people smugglers scope out the area around Jalan Jaksa for potential customers. Asylum seekers pass around numbers for contacting smugglers,     often via the smugglers’ low-level operatives. Some asylum seekers depart with the smugglers within a matter of days, at an average cost of about     $5,000 per person. Some arrive in Indonesia with no plan to catch a boat, no matter how long the legitimate resettlement process might take. Others find     out they have too little money for the trip. Others lose their nerve when they realise just how likely they are to become one of the hundreds who die at     sea.</p><style>

	Cisarua is where people wait, for either the slow wheels of UN bureaucracy to turn, or for the sudden call from a smugglers’ agent: get your things ready, eat, we’re leaving tonight.
	
</div><p>CISARUA IS WHERE PEOPLE WAIT, for either the slow wheels of UN bureaucracy to turn, or for the sudden call from a smugglers’ agent: get your things     ready, eat, we’re leaving tonight.</p><p>Driving through Cisarua at night, you notice, on top of the chaos of any Indonesian town, the disproportionately large numbers of young foreign men. Shia     Muslim Hazaras from both sides of the deadly Afghanistan-Pakistan border form the largest group; they are men with Asian features who, in a few cases, can     pass for Indonesians. The Afghans among them are usually fleeing the Taliban, which is resurgent in much of the country. The Pakistanis are fleeing another     Taliban-like group, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, which has killed hundreds of Hazaras this year in assassinations and bombings.</p><p>The young men are often sent as representatives of a family, on the assumption that they can work to support themselves in Australia, maybe send some money     back, and eventually sponsor the emigration of their relatives.</p><p>Flurries of activity around these streets tend to be the result of grim news. When a boat sinks or goes missing on its way to Australia, for example, the     desperate calls from relatives start coming in to acquaintances still here. Information — on who is missing, who has been detained, who has escaped,     and who has bribed their way out — moves quickly.</p><p>But generally the young men sleep until late in the day and wander around at night. This has annoyed the local government so much that the subdistrict     chief, Teddi Pembang, is trying to get all asylum seekers moved down into the nearby city of Bogor.</p><p>As one local official, Koko Kosasih says: “Day is night for them and night is day. It’s a cultural difference. This is a Muslim community.     People here are trying to sleep and they’re out on the streets, sexually harassing women.”</p><p>Cisarua has become a town filled with the young and bored.</p><p>“What should we do, sir?” asylum seeker Ghulam Rasool Haidari asks me. “Everything, like, every day — it repeats.”</p><p>Rasool is a 17-year-old from the dangerous Afghan province of Ghazni. He shares two small rooms with seven other Afghans, mostly from his home district. All of them arrived last year, but only one, Zakaria Turabi, also 17, has ever set foot on a boat. It was the    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/how-much-would-you-risk-to-start-a-new-life-in-australia/412/">same boat</a> boarded last year by <em>The Global     Mail</em>’s photographer, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theglobalmail.org/feature/what-people-smuggling-looks-like/428/">Barat Ali Batoor</a>, and which ran aground     on Java.</p><div  class="small-image-box left"><a href="http://cdn.theglobalmail.org/cache/f2/87/f287b2b3b3dac7a44099c096480fa54e.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="Zakaria Turabi, 17, from Afghanistan’s Ghazni province."><img class="small-image" src="http://cdn.theglobalmail.org/cache/50/98/5098ffe19b6d565469e18403ad2c34a6.jpg" alt="&lt;p&gt;Barat Ali Batoor&lt;/p&gt;" width="250" height="374"/><div class="slide-hover"></div></a><div class="story-bottom-box small-box"><div class="attribution"><p>Barat Ali Batoor</p></div><div class="caption">Zakaria Turabi, 17, from Afghanistan’s Ghazni province.</div></div></div><p>All of this group say they lack the money and the appetite for a journey by sea, so they simply wait for their cases to be processed by the UNHCR. Long     lines often form at Internet cafes and clumps of men spend hours in front of the local supermarket, Britania, just passing the time. One afternoon I see an Iranian man, accompanied by a local woman, arrive at the supermarket in a Jakarta taxi. He confers with a group of Hazara men and paces the lot, talking into his phone,     before hopping back into the car and heading for town. It’s as close as I get to sighting an actual smuggler, and there’s no way to know for     sure that that is what he was.</p><p>Many asylum seekers have the same experience. “Nobody can see the smugglers, where they live, where they are,” says Rasool. “We just     contact by phone.”</p><p>There are things a young man can do here if he has some money, as do a small number of them. While most asylum seekers only travel to Jakarta for     appointments with the UNHCR, a few make forays into Jakarta’s 24-hour nightlife. Clubs such as the drug-soaked multilevel Chinatown establishment, Stadium, and hotel bars are also popular with many smugglers.</p><p>Among the asylum seekers, Iranians tend to have the most money. Hazaras frequently mutter that they suspect the Iranians of faking their asylum-seeker     claims.</p><p>With work banned, one of the only ways to actually earn money is to help the smugglers. Many of the big operators have no claim to asylum themselves, but     their subordinates are often asylum seekers. Working as a smugglers’ agent can bring in decent money, as well as a free berth on a boat to Australia     in the future.</p><p>Rasool and his friends have little love for the smugglers. “These smugglers are frauds, they’re liars. They take a huge amount from people and     don’t spend it on the boats. If the smugglers spent it properly we wouldn’t have all these tragedies,” says Ahmad Aloudal, a 30-year-old     from Afghanistan’s Taliban-hit Ghazni province.</p><p>But opinions are divided on whether it’s acceptable to work for such fraudulent operators.</p><p>“People whose patience and money runs out are forced to start working with the smugglers,” says Mahmoud Muradi, also from Ghazni.     “It’s not okay. Smuggling itself is a crime.”</p><p>His friend Juma Fayazi sees it differently. Sure, smugglers “take us and they kill us,” he says. “But I think it’s alright if     people work for them. They have no other option.”</p><p>Down in Jakarta, I meet a man who has found a way to make money from the smugglers, without joining the game. Younes — not his real name — takes the smugglers’ money, but hates them. He’s also a misfit among his own people in     Indonesia, which is why he lives apart from others of his community. A Pakistani Hazara with an obvious air of recklessness, he says he is not a victim of     the Taliban and its allies, but claims that he fled Pakistan after being arrested and beaten at the behest of conservative Shia clerics.</p><style>

	I see an Iranian man arrive at the supermarket in a Jakarta taxi. He confers with a group of Hazara men and paces the lot, talking into his phone, before hopping back into the car and heading for town. It’s as close as I get to sighting an actual smuggler.

	
</div><p>When Younes arrived in Indonesia in 2012, he didn’t have enough money to get on a boat. What he did have was Indonesian language skills from an     earlier, four-year stint in the country. Back then, a decade ago, a boat he boarded sank not far off the coast. Younes says when the smugglers then refused     to return his money, he simply stole it back.</p><p>Younes says he has made money by extorting smugglers twice in the past year. Taking up position near Jalan Jaksa, he waits to spot agents as they deal     with new arrivals. He then approaches with the help of Indonesian acquaintances. Sometimes they are women — “just bitches”, he explains,     meaning sex workers – and sometimes men, street characters from central Jakarta. They then demand money from the smuggler, using various threats and     assumed personas as persuasion.</p><p>For example, Younes describes his latest such robbery: “I have some Indonesian friends. I told them a game we’re going to do, something like     that. You pretend to be a policeman, police for foreigners, without any uniform. So I just blame [the smuggler, saying], ‘He’s mafia and he     took from me $5,000 to send me to Australia but he cheated me.’</p><p>“I tell the guy [the smuggler]: ‘He’s a policeman.’ And my friend takes his hand, ‘Let’s go to the police     station.’ He’s scared. He knows that if he goes inside, they have to pay more than US $100,000. So I just took his bag. Inside the bag was     $20,000. But I share with the Indonesians.”</p><p>Younes’ take-home pay from that encounter was $10,000 — more than enough for a spot on a boat, but not enough to erase the bad name he has     earned among the smugglers.</p><p>He loathes them all, yet he says, “I’m happy if the smugglers send my people safely to Australia, because all the Hazaras came here to reach     Australia.</p><p>“[But] if someone does the overloading [of boats], I really want to fuck them.”</p><p>WITH ITS VIEW ACROSS A TERRACED, EMERALD VALLEY, the house in Cisarua in which four families wait for their future to begin appears at first to be idyllic.     But signs of decay ruin the effect: a swimming pool, drained but for ankle-deep, green sludge; a stack of rotting timber and asbestos roofing; a crumbling     concrete giraffe painted brown with white spots.</p><p>Each family lives in a separate section, divided from the others by plywood partitions. Rukhsana Jaffary, her husband and her three children arrived from     Quetta, Pakistan, in February 2002, and say they have never intended to get on a boat. The total cost of some $25,000 is just too much.</p><p>They are among about 3,000 people in Indonesia receiving housing and a modest stipend – about $125 per person per month — from the    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iom.or.id/">International Organization for Migration</a> (IOM), while they await processing of     their asylum claims. But the family is facing a crunch: their claim has been rejected. If an appeal fails, they will lose the home and the     stipend.</p><div  class="large-image-box left"><a href="http://cdn.theglobalmail.org/cache/7b/e8/7be8cae8ac4489580aa8d6dfbdcd42ce.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="A local government official flicks through the UNHCR files of asylum seekers registered in his subdistrict."><img class="large-image" src="http://cdn.theglobalmail.org/cache/7b/11/7b11a4bc9332c223d616b140cb314cf2.jpg" alt="&lt;p&gt;Barat Ali Batoor&lt;/p&gt;" width="620" height="414"/><div class="slide-hover"></div></a><div class="story-bottom-box large-box"><div class="attribution"><p>Barat Ali Batoor</p></div><div class="caption">A local government official flicks through the UNHCR files of asylum seekers registered in his subdistrict.</div></div></div><p>“Every time I wake up, the feeling is just uncertainty,” says Jaffary. “We wake up each day hoping this will be the last morning, that     we’ll be able to start living normally again,” she says.</p><p>“Pakistan is finished. I wish Pakistan got better. We’d go back. We were happy there. Nothing can replace where you were born.”</p><p>Jaffary blames the failure of their claim so far on poor translation and the complexity of their case. Her husband, Ghulam Raza, is an Afghan     citizen who has lived in Iran and claims to be the subject of a decades-long blood feud which would see him persecuted in Afghanistan, Iran or Pakistan,     were they to return to any of these countries.</p><p>A final rejection of their claim would also mean the family’s children, who range between six and 12 years old, would lose the three days a week of     education they are getting from an IOM school — which has still not been enough to stop them falling behind their peers who receive full-time     schooling.</p><p>So Jaffary asks me a question I can’t answer: “If the UNHCR rejects us, should we take a boat to Australia?”</p><p>Upstairs, in another section of the house, Mehdi Javid Kian Ali, a 37-year-old, exists in a similar limbo with his wife, Elaheh, and their six-year-old     daughter, Asal, a curly-haired girl with a permanent dimpled smile. They are also UNHCR rejects who are appealing the decision on their case for the same     reason: poor translation.</p><style>

</div><p>Before being moved into this home, the family had spent nearly two years in detention in converted cheap hotels, after their attempt to board a boat was     foiled. At one stage in the ensuing proceedings, Kian Ali claims that police, immigration officials and smugglers offered them a chance to bribe their way     out of detention. It was an opportunity they declined; and that turned out to be a good thing.</p><p>“The police came down to bargain. ‘We’ll let you go with the boat. For $1,000 you can leave’,” he recalls. “The     smugglers came and the guards were very polite to them. We didn’t have the money but the other families went. They got out and drove three metres     down the street before the police jumped out with guns drawn and stopped them again and brought them back into detention. The guards charged them $200 to     get each of their bags back. But when they got them all their cameras, jewellery and valuables were missing.”</p><p>Kian Ali’s claim for asylum is a simple one for a citizen of the Islamic Republic of Iran: he doesn’t believe in God. As a young man, Kian Ali     claims to have worked for Iran’s notorious Revolutionary Guard, during which time he observed close-up the torture of opponents of the regime at     Tehran’s Prison 59. The treatment that particularly got to him, he says, was the practice of using funnels to insert boiled eggs into the vaginas and     anuses of detainees. “This was all in the name of Islam.”</p><p>It quickly becomes that Kian Ali is not the kind of man who keeps his head down and his opinions to himself. “I’m anti-Shia, I’m     anti-Islam. If you hand me a rocket launcher, I’ll blow up the Kaaba,” he says, referring to Islam’s holiest site.</p><div  class="large-image-box left"><a href="http://cdn.theglobalmail.org/cache/cf/14/cf146c8ac330897c9588a9d6bbbcef68.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="Elaheh Davoud Abadi Farahani, left, a 26-year-old asylum seeker from Iran.

It shows a beheading, one of     the many gruesome recordings to come out of the Syrian civil war. It’s not his home country, but he sees all such religiously motivated brutality as     linked.</p><p>I try to change the subject, but Kian Ali insists: he holds the screen in front of my face and makes me watch the footage of a terrified young man, a     government soldier and presumably a Shia, being held to the ground with a knife to his throat. His captors, Sunni extremist rebels, intone in Arabic,     cursing him as an idolator and an enemy of the faith. Wielded with a rapid sawing motion, the knife cuts through the man’s throat and blood surges     onto the ground. Kian Ali moves the screen closer. Finally, the dead man’s head is separated from his body and triumphantly rested on his chest.</p><p>Kian Ali takes the tablet away. He gets up and moves to the edge of his bed, leans forward and sighs. Outside the clouds tear open and it starts bucketing     rain, just as it does almost every day at this time of year.</p></div></article><div id="related" class="related clearfix"><div class="related-title">Related stories</div><div class="double-line"></div><div class="rows"><div clas="related-row"><div class="article"><a href=" /feature/how-much-would-you-risk-to-start-a-new-life-in-australia/412/"><img src="http://cdn.theglobalmail.org/cache/90/04/900422501fb75886942e5ece829731e0.jpg"/><h2>How Much Would You Risk To Start A New Life In Australia?</h2></a></div><div class="article"><a href=" /feature/what-people-smuggling-looks-like/428/"><img src="http://cdn.theglobalmail.org/cache/0e/ac/0eac114c54675db51e9f51f432b90599.jpg"/><h2>What People Smuggling Looks Like</h2></a></div></div><div clas="related-row"><div class="article"><a href=" /feature/in-between-persecution-and-asylum/586/"><img src="http://cdn.theglobalmail.org/cache/c9/1b/c91b35851bc8f605915ebb71ba7aee4d.jpg"/><h2>In Between Persecution And Asylum</h2></a></div><div class="article"><a href=" /feature/is-a-notorious-people-smuggler-back-in-business/595/"><img src="http://cdn.theglobalmail.org/cache/e3/06/e306acfd7dc8f3a024790abe77a8c7c0.jpg"/><h2>Is A Notorious People Smuggler Back In Business?</h2></a></div></div><div clas="related-row"><div class="article"><a href=" /feature/desperate-to-leave-the-deathtrap-of-quetta/518/"><img src="http://cdn.theglobalmail.org/cache/05/82/05825567b36928c730fa11ea85a211b1.jpg"/><h2>Desperate To Leave The Deathtrap Of Quetta  </h2></a></div><div class="article"><a href=" /feature/australias-deadly-game/519/"><img src="http://cdn.theglobalmail.org/cache/7e/3b/7e3bf6bcf318c9435b1b20a9d71aacbe.jpg"/><h2>Australia’s Deadly Game</h2></a></div></div></div></div><!-- required for IE 7 when a quote is near the bottom of the story --><div style="clear: both"></div><div class="row page-break" id="comments"><div class="span8"><div class="comments-divider"></div><div class="comment-list">18 comments on this story</div><div class="more-comments"><div class="comment"><div class="inner-comment"><img class="comments-profile-image" src="http://cdn.theglobalmail.org/static//images/story/comments-profile.png" class="user-avatar"><div class="comment-right-column"><div class="comment-author">by Marilyn</div><div class="comment-text"><p>1,  it is not smuggling.

In this outstanding article he mentioned the everyday life of asylum seekers. There are numbers of problems asylum seekers face in Indonesia. Although the Australian Govt. helps and donates millions of Dollars to the Indonesian Authorities, but less spent on refugees. In most detention centers families are kept with other males. The process of the UN seems to be very slow. <br />Another problems encountering asylum seekers is because of these &#39;Saudi Sex Tourists.&#39; Most of the prostitutes can&#39;t differentiate between asylum seekers and Arab Sex tourists. These Sex   tourists, sometimes don&#39;t pay to prostitutes, So the burden comes on asylum seekers.  There is no limits for these Gulf sex tourists. They are looking for virgins, most of the Syrian refugees also facing this problem. For ordinary people in these Sheikhdoms, the so called &#39;Contract Marriage&#39; or &#39;Temporary Marriage&#39; are forbidden, but for the Royal and elite family of these these Sex Tourists allowed to quench their sex thirsts. <br />I don&#39;t understand why the Iranian put themselves in this condition. There isn&#39;t any political crises or war or sectarian violence. Merely a person doesn&#39;t believe in God, can&#39;t be the reason to seek asylum. If Kian Ali has worked for the Iran&#39; Revolutionary Guard, he should show the proof.  By showing a video that the Wahabi terrorists beheading ordinary citizens in Syria, isn&#39;t the answer to seek asylum.<br />Australia&#39;s humanitarian program is for persecuted, oppressed and war-torn people. As far as the Hazara people is concerned they are the most educated people among the Afghan people. They faced injustice, war, systematic discrimination and now they being slughtered and killed in Pakistan in broad daylight, just because they are Hazara, remain peaceful and belong to Shia sect. They are being targeded because they want to do business, progress towards a better tomorrow, get education. <br />Thanks once again Aubrey Belford for such nice article.<br />From an Afghan-Hazara Asylum seeker. <br /><br /></p></div><div class="comment-date">April 8, 2013 @ 12:46am</div></div></div></div><div class="comment-shadow"></div><div class="comment"><div class="inner-comment"><img class="comments-profile-image" src="http://cdn.theglobalmail.org/static//images/story/comments-profile.png" class="user-avatar"><div class="comment-right-column"><div class="comment-author">by Naseer Fedaee Turkmani</div><div class="comment-text"><p>Just can say ...

It is a strikingly accurate presentation of the situation.Sadly, as with most articles the focus is on the plight of the asylum seekers, and has failed to depict the pitiful plight of the impoverished Indonesians who are trafficked to this region to support the hypocritical practice of contractual marriages. Younes&#39; use of the term &#39;just bitches&#39; says it all really.It displays an attitude to Indonesian women that resonates throughout the asylum seeker communities in Lombok, Jakarta, Cisuara and Sumbawa. These people use and abuse the Indonesian poor and see them as a disposable commodity: women, girls and young boys as sex objects and fishing crew as sacrificial lambs who are well forgotten as they rot in Australian jails. Kasian for the orang miskin of Indonesia who have to debase themselves to simply feed their families.</p></div><div class="comment-date">April 10, 2013 @ 8:40am</div></div></div></div><div class="comment-shadow"></div><div class="comment"><div class="inner-comment"><img class="comments-profile-image" src="http://cdn.theglobalmail.org/static//images/story/comments-profile.png" class="user-avatar"><div class="comment-right-column"><div class="comment-author">by Rachel </div><div class="comment-text"><p>Thank you Aubrey and TGM for continuing to cover the &#39; asylum seeker/Ausralia issue&#39; with such depth and without shying away from its complexities - you are one of the only sources to do so. <br />It&#39;s always refreshing to read an article that puts PEOPLE at the centre of the ongoing debate, instead of being caught up in the politics or referring to asylum seekers as the nameless &#39;other&#39;.

The Australian Government is in cahoots with the Sinhalese Government &#39;cos it serves their interests in terms of deterring the asylum seekers who come here.  But the Australian Government working with the Sri Lanka Government is pretty diabolical - with its record of genocide...  Of course with the Tamil people still leaving in huge numbers  - no - one here is asking why is it that they are willing to risk their lives on the open high seas to come here.  I hear that they are still having a very very hard time there... I have heard that still no journalists are allowed in the north - where the majority of the remaining Tamil people are.   And of course CHOGM is going to be held there.  There is the beginnings of a push to boycott CHOGM being held in Sri Lanka on human rights grounds.

He also reiterated his policy to &quot;stop the boats&quot; by turning back and towing back WHEN IT IS SAFE TO DO SO. I put the last in capitals as I have never understood this qualification as, obviously, boats would not be towed or turned back when not safe to do so, would they ?<br />This policy - which is never queried or probed by our media - is baffling as how on earth can you tow back or turn back boats to Sri Lanka , a considerable distance and obviously never a safe strategy and the Sri Lankan government has already expressly ruled out accepting this policy. With Indonesia, we again know that the Indonesian government has rejected this tow back strategy and for Australia to ignore this objection and just go ahead would have dire results for our relationship with Indonesia.<br />So, what exactly is the policy of the coalition and why are our media so reluctant to explore the details ?<br /></p></div><div class="comment-date">April 23, 2013 @ 8:54am</div></div></div></div><div class="comment-shadow"></div><div class="comment"><div class="inner-comment"><img class="comments-profile-image" src="http://cdn.theglobalmail.org/static//images/story/comments-profile.png" class="user-avatar"><div class="comment-right-column"><div class="comment-author">by Marilyn</div><div class="comment-text"><p>Because Terrence our useless media all seem to accept that we own the ocean and the world&#39;s borders are ours to control.</p><p>They won&#39;t even understand that we have zero right to stop one person from leaving one other country, we have no right to jail people in other countries and expect them to stay in danger and we have no right to stop one person entering here to ask for help.</p><p>Much easier to babble about the non-existent nonsense of people smuggling.</p></div><div class="comment-date">April 25, 2013 @ 4:51pm</div></div></div></div><div class="comment-shadow"></div><div class="comment"><div class="inner-comment"><img class="comments-profile-image" src="http://cdn.theglobalmail.org/static//images/story/comments-profile.png" class="user-avatar"><div class="comment-right-column"><div class="comment-author">by Joe of Taylors</div><div class="comment-text"><p>Im a atheist as well.
